# MATLAB Changepoint Detection Algorithms
This includes all files used for changepoint detection with the `findchangepts` function built into MATLAB.

Feel free to reach out to me with any questions, or concerns, or even updates! I'd love to hear more about the progress of this project :)

## Which algorithm is which?
There are two algorithms, one for the insects from the 2020 Hyalite dataset, and one for the bees from the 2022 bee dataset. Everything that pertains to the Hyalite dataset has 'insect' in its, everything for the bees have 'bee' in its name.
